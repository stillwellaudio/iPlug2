# iPlug 2 Dependencies

Several small 3rd party libraries are vendored directly in the iPlug2 repo but there are some things such as plug-in SDKs that you have to install.

Some optional dependencies can be downloaded and built locally using scripts in the Extras and IGraphics sub-folders. Alternatively, you can download pre-built versions that are generated by continuous integration servers.

The subfolder "Build" should contain these built libraries with sub-folders for each platform.

Please use the script `download-prebuilt-libs.sh` to get the correct version of the libs from the iPlug2 releases page on github.

```
oli@mbp ~/Dev/iPlug2/Dependencies$ ./download-prebuilt-libs.sh
```

You can add the argument "ios" to get the ios package.
